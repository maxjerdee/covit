Project idea

1. Tinder -- but for orphans!
2. Craigslist for Princeton
    - Users have ratings based on reliability, returning items, etc
        - Who should be able to see ratings? How do we generate those ratings?
        - Allow users to appeal?
    - Auto deduct and return deposit
        - How to protect against abuse
        - Need to have option to appeal
        - When should we remove deposit?
            - Could users cancel credit cards to avoid deposit being taken?
            - Paypal solution?
    - Traditional payment or free or exchange
    - CAS Login
    - Different sections / forums for different services?
    - Products or services? Limitation on acceptable postings?
        - Report post / user / seller option
        - Automatically search for certain phrases and forward to us for review
        - Ban or ding ratings of spam posters
    - What kind of accountability could we offer for users?
        - Allow users to request transaction history in case of theft?
    - Security concerns
        - If processing credit card info, need high security
        - Third party payment application or first-party? Security tradeoffs of each
        - Protect transaction histories of users (from other users and from ourselves)
    - Search functionality
        - Tags vs user-created descriptions vs categories
    - Database:

        - name

        - rating
        - if no paypal, credit card info
    - flexible rental period
        - renter indicates they've gotten it
        - owner indicates they've gotten it returned
    - meet ups?
        - chat? email?
        - send location to meet up?
        - maps?

    - In textbook category, auto-pull 1st image from Google images to show cover of a textbook with any given name
